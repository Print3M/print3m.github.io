### 3.1. Stripped DLL
When a DLL is stripped, unnecessary symbols and debugging information are removed, but symbols (functions, variables, etc.) that are essential for the DLL to function as intended are preserved. These essential symbols are what other executables or DLLs will link to. The stripped DLL retains the necessary header information that describes its exported functions and data.
