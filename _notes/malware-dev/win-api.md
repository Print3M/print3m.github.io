## 1. Overview
In Linux the OS interface is provided to the programmer using pseudo-files (POSIX standard) and glibc standard functions (on top of the syscalls). In Windows there is a huge set of dedicated functions used to get info about the system. This set is called WinAPI or Win32. WinAPI DLLs are built in every Windows OS. WinAPI is used in the user-space but it's somehow similar to the Linux kernel-space API. In general, WinAPI is very old and messy. There is a lot of libraries (GUI libraries for example) which provide a layers of abstraction on top of the WinAPI to make a developer's life easier. To be honest, actually no one uses WinAPI for GUI development directly because it's very low-level and C-based.

## 2. Malware development
WinAPI is used by malware developers in a malicious way. Some :

## 3. Windows.h
`windows.h` is a Windows-specific header file (C/C++) which contains declarations for all assets (functions, consts, classes, types, enums, macros) in the Windows API. It includes a number of child header files (e.g. `windef.h`, `winreg.h`, `winsvc.h`, `winuser.h`) which are mentioned in the documentation but should not be included separately. There is no equivalent for that in the Linux world.

## 4. Naming
It's common to see specific suffixes in the WinAPI functions' names.

- `A` - 8-bit char ANSI strings ([doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/working-with-strings)) - standard C strings.
- `W` - unicode strings
- `Ex` - extended (better, newer) functionality
