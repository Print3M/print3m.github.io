## Web pentest

* XSS:
  * DOM based:
    * Check if front-end JS code is readable
    * Look for XSS sources (e.g. window.location)
  * Reflected:
    * Check GET / POST / PUT / PATCH params (keys and values!)
    * Check what you get in the response
  * Stored:
    * Check DB inputs (creating or updating objects, logs)
    * Check what is obtained from DB
    * Maybe PUT / PATCH has different validation than POST?
  * DOM based via postMessage()
    * Check if there is an event listener 'message' added with none or wrong origin validation, keywords: `postMessage(`, `addEventListener('message'`, `.on('message'`.
    * Create malicious website with `window.open('http://victim.com)` and send an malicious message to it: `victim.postMessage({data: 'xss'}, '*')`
    * It might be needed to bypass origin restrictions
    * Browser extensions to sniff messages: `Posta`, `MessPostage`
  * Stored DOM based:
* Content-Type incorrectly stated:
  * The goal is to see "executable" Content-Type in a controlled response
  * [Potentially dangerous MIME Content-Types](https://github.com/BlackFan/content-type-research/blob/master/XSS.md)
  * Try to force server with "Accept: content/type" header in a request

* CRLF injection:
  * HTTP header injection:
    * `URL?p=1\r\nHeader=New-Value\r\n`
    * `URL?p=1%0d%0aHeader=New-Value%0d%0a`
  * HTTP reponse splitting (content injection):
    * `URL?p=1\r\n\r\n<script>alert(1)</script`

* SQL injection:
* SQL injection (second order):
* SSTI:
  * Is this app MPA?

* CSRF:
* On-site Request Forgery
* SSRF:
* XXE:
* IDOR:
  * Find out how current object is obtained
  * Look for fields like: id, uuid, uid, pk, index
  * Check GET params, e.g. /?bill_id=123
  * Check path params, e.g. /path/to/bill/123
  * Check POST data
  * Check custom HTTP headers
  * Try to add your field to an object creation request
  * Try to add your field to the path as GET param
  * Check HTTP parameter pollution (many values for the same param)
  * UUID most often is enough:
  * Most often it's passed in URL (is stored in logs, history etc.)
  * Leakage of URL with UUID == leakage of information

* Authorization bypass:
* Cryptographic failures:
* Dangerous deserialization:
* Open redirection:
* CORS errors:
* CSV injection:
* DNS rebinding:
* Session fixation:
* Host header poisoning:
* Prototype pollution
* HTTP parameter pollution:
* HTTP Verb Tempering:
* Time-based enumeration:
* Brute-force prevention bypass:
  * Login attempts counter might be reset by successfully logging in
  * X-Forworded-For bypass (IP spoofing)
  * Proxy IP rotation bypass (changing IP)
* Reverse Proxy Bypass
  * Check in URL: `/..;/..;/`, `/path//`, `/path../`, `/path/#/../`, `@path/`
* TRACE method
* Arbitrary file upload:
  * Bypass filter:
    * Change extension to non-standard
    * Randomize letter case
  * Upload the same file twice (might cause an interesting error)
  * Try with path traversal in filename (arbitrary file overwrite)

* Clickjacking
* Denial of Service (DoS):
  * Try to send long password (hashing process) to exhaust CPU resources

* ReDoS - DoS with regex
* HTTP request smuggling
* Web cache poisoning

## Linux Privelege escalation

* Check `sudo -ll`
* Check `cat /etc/shells`
* Check `env`
* Check history files in home directory
  * `find . -type f -name ".*history"`
* Find all SUID files on the system
  * `find / -perm /u=s 2>/dev/null`
    Some interesting:
    * doas - config: /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
  * GTFO bins
  * Binary PATH hijacking
* Check `cat .bashrc`
* Check CRON:
  * `cat /etc/crontab`
  * `ls -lah /etc/cron*`
* Check processes and daemons:
  * `ps -U root -u root u`
  * `ps aux`
  * `watch -n 1 "ps -aux"`
* Check if `/etc/passwd` is writable
* Check networking
  * `netstat -tulpn` - ports
  * `ip a` - network interfaces
  * `route` / `routel` - cached routes
  * `cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4` - iptables
* Find writable directories:
  * `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`
* List all filesystems:
  * `cat /etc/fstab`
* List all available disks:
  * `lsblk`
* List kernel modules:
  * `lsmod`
  * `/sbin/modinfo $module` - read about kernel module.
* Check git repositories:
  * `find / -type d -name ".git" 2>/dev/null`
* Unprivileged Linux process snooping (by reading /proc/ filesystem data) `pspy`
* Check `/opt` directory
* Check `/tmp` directory
* Check Nginx / Apache / DNS / proxy settings.
* Check installed packages:
  * `dpkg -l`
* Password spraying: try all login-password combinations you have everywhere
* Check log files
* Grep for secrets
* Default service passwords
* Check kernel exploitation:
  * `uname -r`
  * `arch`
  * `searchsploit`
* Use automatic scanners:
  * `unix-privesc-check`
  * `linpeas`

## If you stuck

* Enumerate TCP server services
* Check out exploits for services
* Enumarate directories
* Enumerate files
* Enumerate subdomains (DNS and brute-force)
* Check out exploits for web components / assets / libraries
* Check out website cookies, local storage, network tab, etc.
* Enumerate UDP server services
* Check input and GET parameters:
  * SQL injection
  * Command injection
  * Path traversal & LFI
  * Template injection
* Check if somewhere credentials are reused
