## 1. Principles
Obfuscation can be done on many different layers of code using various techniques. Check: [Layered obfuscation: a taxonomy of software obfuscation techniques for layered security](https://cybersecurity.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s42400-020-00049-3.pdf). Of course almost always it's automated task but it's worth to know the basic principles of this process.

### 1.1. Data obfuscation

- Array transformation - transforming an array by splitting, merging, folding, and flattening.
- Data Encoding - encodes data with mathematical functions.
- Data Procedurization - substitutes static data with procedure calls.
- Data splitting - distributes information of one variable into several new variables.

### 1.2. Layout obfuscation

- Junk Code - junk and non-functional pieces of code.
- Separation of Related Code - separate related code to increase difficulty in reading the program.
- Stripping Redundant Symbols - strip e.g. debug information.
- Meaningless Identifiers - meaningless e.g. variable names.
