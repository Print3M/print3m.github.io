title: Radars and how they works - notes

Radar waves == radio waves.

Monopole antenna consists of a straight rod-shaped conductor. Usually it might be seen in a form of a mast radiator. The mast itself is connected to the transmitter and radiates the radio waves.

Electromagnetic waves are  

EM frequencies are organised into groups called **bands**. Most common naming convention for these bands are IEEE, ITU and NATO standards. [List of all EM bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum#ITU).

RADAR is an acronym for _Radio Aim Detecting And Ranging_.

Main goal of a radar is to determine a distance, a direction and a height of an object. It can work because of several phisical observations.

1. All electromagnetic (EM) waves travel at the same speed (almost speed of light within the atmosphere) about 300.000 kilometers per second. The constant speed of EM wave allows the determination of the distance between the reflecting object and the radar.
2. Electromagnetic waves are reflected if they meet an electrically leading surface.
3. EM waves normally travels in a straight line and varies only slightly due to armospheric conditions.

Direction of an object is determined based on the directivity of the antenna. Simply, a radar system knows where the reflecting object is because it knows where the antenna was when the EM beam was sent and reflected. Antennas are typically 360 degree rotatable at a constat speed.
