## 1. Antivirus (AV)
Antivirus software works in real-time scanning all open and used files in the background. Full system scan is usually performed during the installation of the antivirus. AV software performs scanning, detecting and removing malicious files. Traditionally, it works only with files.

Common malware detection techniques:

- Signature-based detection - AV compares the scanned file with a database of known malicious signatures and patterns. The database must be up to date. It tries to find unique strings, checksums and sequence of bytes of known malicious code.
- Heuristic-based detection - most often engages machine learning to decide whether a file is malicious. It scans and statically analyses binary and behavior in real-time.
- Behavior-based detection - AV monitors and examines the execution of binary to find suspicious activities and API calls (e.g. register editing, process spawning, filesystem modifications, log events, web requests).

> **NOTE**: _EICAR_ file is a special standarized file to test AV abilities (fake malware).
> **NOTE**: Nowadays, many antivirus softwares integrate traditional AV functionalities with some of the EDR features.

### 1.1. Features

- Compressors and Archives - AVs usually support various file formats, including compressed and archived files, where it can self-extract and inspect all compressed files. Malicious code often tries to hide itself in compressed files.
- PE Parsing and Unpackers - malware hides and packs its code by compressing and encrypting it within a executable (PE). It decompresses and decrypts itself only during runtime. It makes it hard to perform static analysis. AVs should support unpacking most of the known PE packers (UPX, Armidillo, ASPack) for static analysis. AV also parses PE headers and looks for suspicious fields.
- Emulators - emulator can run suspicious files (PE, DLL, etc.) in a virtualized environment, performing the behavior-based detection. Malware developers implement checks to not work within the virtual or simulated environment.

### 1.2. Windows Defender
It is a pre-installed antivirus that runs on users' machine. MS defender runs in:

- Active mode - when is used as primary AV software
- Passive mode - when there is another 3rd party AV software installed

## 2. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR software provides real-time protection based on behavioral analytics. EDR monitors various security aspects in the target machine, including memory, network connections, executed commands, processes and Windows registry.

## 3. Firewall
It's main purpose is to control the inbound and outbound traffic that goes through the device's interface. A firewall acts as control access at the network layer. It is capable of allowing and denying network packets. It can be a seperate physical device (usually very expensive) or a software. `Windows Defender Firewall` and `Linux Iptables` are examples of software firewalls. A firewall compares the packets against a set of rules before passing or blocking it. It might block TCP packets sent to a certain port or packets from a certain host.

Most often firewalls focus on layer 3 (IPv4, IPv6) and 4 (TCP, UDP). Advanced firewalls also can inspect other ISO/OSI layers, such as application layers (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) - e.g. they can detect and block SQL injection or reflected XSS payloads.

### 3.1. Evasion during network scan

#### 3.1.1. Controlling the Source MAC/IP/Port

**Decoy**
`Nmap` has an option to hide IP of the attacker's host using decoys - sending many packets with spoofed IPs. Because of the flood of different IPs, it's difficult for the firewall to find out where the scan is coming from. Also it can exhaust the blue team resources to investigate all IPs.

```bash
# Specified IPs
nmap <IP> -D <decoy-IPs-comma-seperated>

# Random IPs + one specific
nmap <IP> -D RND,RND,RND,192.168.1.25
```

**MAC Spoofing**
Spofing the MAC address (`--spoof-mac <MAC>`) works only if your system is on the same network sagment. The target system is going to reply to a spoofed MAC address. If you are not on the same network segment, sharing the same Ethernet, you wonâ€™t be able to capture and read the responses.

**IP Spoofing**
Spoofing the IP address (`-S <IP>`) works only if your system is on the subnetwork. This technique can be used to exploit trust relationships on the network based on IP addresses.

**IP Packet fragmentation**
`-f` (8 bytes) and `-ff` (16 bytes) options in Nmap allow to split IP packet into smaller packets. Using `--mtu <number>` parameter you can specify the maximum packet size (IP data). One IP packet can be divided into multiple smaller packets carring legit TCP connection but evading the firewall.

## 4. System Monitor (Sysmon)
Sysmon is a service and device driver - one of the MS Sysinternals suite. It's not installed by default. This logging system helps system administrators and blue teamers to detect and investigate malicious activity.

Sysmon can log many default and custom events, e.g.:

- Process creation and termination
- Network connections
- File manipulation
- Memory access

[More info about Sysmon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

> **NOTE**: For a red-teamer it is essential to know whether the Sysmon logging software is installed or not. It is important to avoid causing generating and alerting events.

## 5. User Account Control (UAC)
UAC is mechanism introduced in Windows Vista. UAC is a security feature that forces any new process to run in the security context of a non-privileged account by default.

For example, when a **local** user logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with full administrator permissions even if the user is a member of the _Administrators_ group (almost every user by default). When UAC is enabled, a running application doesn't inherit access token privileges of the privileged user by default. Same situation occurs when local account is connected via RPC, SMB or WinRM, etc. The only local account that will get full privileges by default is the default local **Administrator** account itself.

AD account (AD), which is a member of the AD _Administrators_ group, will run with a full administrator acces and UAC won't be in effect.

### 5.1. UAC Elevation
When an operation requires higher privileges, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit to elevate privileges for that particual application. It is done in a form of yellow popup (GUI) with `yes` or `no` question. `Run as administrator` option requests elevation.

### 5.2. Integrity Levels
UAC works on a basis of _Mandatory Integrity Control_ (MIC). MIC is a concept of additional security control over resources taking into account their **Integrity Level** (IL). Integrity Level is an attribute of processes and users. In general, a user with a higher IL can use processes with lower or equal ILs. IL of a process can be checked using `Process Hacker`. IL of the current user can be checked using `whoami /groups` (_Mandatory Label_).

- LOW - very limited permissions.
- MEDIUM - assigned to standard users and members of the _Administrators_ group.
- HIGH - used by elevated tokens if UAC is enabled. If UAC is disabled, all administrators use this IL by default.
- SYSTEM - reserved for system use.

During logon, non-administrators receive a single access token with medium IL. Administrators recive so-called _Filtered Token_ used for regular operations (medium IL) and _Elevated Token_ with full admin privileges (high IL).

### 5.3. Bypassing UAC
[UACMe - tool to check different UAC bypass techniques](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME).

#### 5.3.1. Auto-elevation
Some executables can auto-elevate to high IL by default, without any user interaction. This applies to most of the Control Panel's functionality and some other built-in executables. To auto-elevate the executable must be signed by the Windows Publisher and must be contained in a trusted directory like `%SystemRoot%/System32` or `%ProgramFiles%/`. Sometimes it must declare `autoElevate` property in the exec manifest file.

#### 5.3.2. Scheduled tasks & environment vars
TBD
